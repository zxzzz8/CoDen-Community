# CoDen-Community-Feedback-Center
Unofficial Feedback Center [Issues ect'] for ''Chronicles of Denzar''

= 3

-

this is a place to share issues and suggestions w the community, 

in order to hopefully avoid duplicates, and resolve mistakes thought as bugs and other misunderstandings among ourselves,

it is in hopes to reduce the load upon the CoDen devs.... ^^

-

not to be confused w the actual tool to report the devs direcly:

https://chroniclesofdenzar.com/feedback.php

it would be best to report in both here and there in most cases, 

(as well as adding the feedback ID that is given there for refrence here)
